motion:
  # Optional: The threshold passed to cv2.threshold to determine if a pixel is different enough to be counted as motion. (default: shown $
  # Increasing this value will make motion detection less sensitive and decreasing it will make motion detection more sensitive.
  # The value should be between 1 and 255.
  threshold: 75
  # Optional: Minimum size in pixels in the resized motion image that counts as motion
  # Increasing this value will prevent smaller areas of motion from being detected. Decreasing will make motion detection more sensitive $
  # moving objects.
  contour_area: 100
  # Optional: Alpha value passed to cv2.accumulateWeighted when averaging the motion delta across multiple frames (default: shown below)
  # Higher values mean the current frame impacts the delta a lot, and a single raindrop may register as motion.
  # Too low and a fast moving person wont be detected as motion.
  delta_alpha: 0.2
  # Optional: Alpha value passed to cv2.accumulateWeighted when averaging frames to determine the background (default: shown below)
  # Higher values mean the current frame impacts the average a lot, and a new object will be averaged into the background faster.
  # Low values will cause things like moving shadows to be detected as motion for longer.

  frame_alpha: 0.2
  # Optional: Height of the resized motion frame  (default: 1/6th of the original frame height)
  # This operates as an efficient blur alternative. Higher values will result in more granular motion detection at the expense of higher $
  # Lower values result in less CPU, but small changes may not register as motion.
